# [Detroit Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Data-Science-Meetup/)
We are a group of people interested in predictive data analytics and data science. Data science is about analyzing the data, asking the right question, and then building a model to answer the question. Our focus is on practical applications of data science.
